# Reproducible Analysis of Galaxy Scaling Relations

## Overview
This project reproduces and analyzes a well-known galaxy scaling relation using publicly available survey data. The goal is to demonstrate a clean, reproducible astrophysical data-analysis workflow.

## Scientific Context
Galaxy scaling relations (e.g. mass-sizw or Tully-Fisher relations) provide insight into galaxy formation and evolution. This project focuses on reproducing a published relation as a first-principles exercise.

## Project Structure
- 'data/' - instructions or scripts to obtain public survey data
- 'src/' - analysis and plotting code
- 'figures/' - generated plots and figures

## Status
Initial setup. Data acquisition and analysis to follow.

## Reproducibility Checkpoint

At this stage, the repository contains:

- a fixed scientific goal (stellar mass–size relation)

- a documented SDSS data acquisition plan

- a runnable analysis entry-point script.

Subsequent commits will focus on data ingestion, quality cuts, and reproduction of the published mass–size relation.
